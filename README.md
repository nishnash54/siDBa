##### Statistical Database analysis
------
siDBa is a software that allows users to import a csv file directly into a data base. It also takes care of data type conversions.
Finally a statistical model of the data base is prepared to help the user understand and interact with the data.


The software aims to allow users to overcome the hastle of manually importing the data base from a csv file, changing the data type and importing into the user data base.


Currently working on importing a csv file into a MongoDB.
